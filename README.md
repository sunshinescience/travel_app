# Travel App Project
This Udacity project involved creating an asynchronous web app which uses multiple API's as well as user input in order to update the UI.

A Node environment was setup with Express. A server was setup with get and post routes. 
Developer credentials were acquired from the from OpenWeatherMap website. The Fetch API was used to get dynamic data into the app routes. Promises were chained together to dynamically update the UI.
